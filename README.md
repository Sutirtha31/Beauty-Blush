# Beauty-Blush
This is a collaborative E-commerce website selling beauty products that I developed with two other collaborators as a part of my Major Project for my Bachelor of Computer Applications program.
The frontend of this website has been developed by me and this repository contains all the files associated with the project.
It has been developed using the languages HTML, CSS, Javascript.
